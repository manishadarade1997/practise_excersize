# Cypress Framework Project

## Overview
This project is a Cypress framework designed for end-to-end testing of web applications. It provides a structured approach to writing tests, organizing test data, and extending Cypress functionality through custom commands and page objects.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
cypress-framework
├── cypress
│   ├── e2e
│   │   └── sample.cy.js        # End-to-end test cases
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   └── example.json        # Test data in JSON format
│   ├── support
│   │   ├── commands.js         # Custom commands
│   │   └── e2e.js              # Global configurations for tests
│   └── pages
│       └── basePage.js         # Base page object for interactions
├── cypress.config.js           # Cypress configuration file
├── package.json                 # npm configuration file
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   To run the tests, use the following command:
   ```

## Usage
- Place your end-to-end test cases in the `cypress/e2e` directory.
- Use the `cypress/fixtures` directory to store any mock data needed for your tests.
- Extend Cypress functionality by adding custom commands in `cypress/support/commands.js`.
- Organize your page interactions using page objects in the `cypress/pages` directory.
